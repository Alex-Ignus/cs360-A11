    <p class="text text-2">Why is this visualization bad? 
        <br>The Title is biased for The USA and against China and India, influencing the reader to think that the USA isnâ€™t part of the of Pollution problem.  
        <br>
      <br>The y-axis missing its scale means that the reader cannot gain any meaningful insight from the data. The most they can get is the direction of a country's Emissions trend.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      <br>China and India are the same color which relates them trading in a Association bias for the reviewer whereas the u.s. line being blue helps it stand out, disassociating it from China and India.
      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>That disassociation is important because we want the viewer to see the United States as an outlier because it's the one that's decreasing in emissions whereas China and India are increasing in comparison&nbsp;<br>
